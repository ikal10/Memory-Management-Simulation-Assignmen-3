What the code does

A Memory block is a chunk of computer memory used to store data for the program

This code demonstrates allocating and deallocating memory

1.the simulation chunk:
creates a  block of memory like making a toy box , we create a little card(Simulation chunk) for each section of the memory block .Each card says:
- where the section starts
- How big the section is 
- if its empty or has junk (called free)
- which section comes next or after
2.Setting up the big block(Vintageblock)
- at the start , we make one big section in the memory block that can hold up all 1000+ items.
3.ChunkAllocator:
-
4.Deallocator
-
5.Display
- displays the current state of memory blocks
