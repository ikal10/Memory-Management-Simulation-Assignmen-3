	Reference String Generator Overview

This Python script (Main1.py) generates a page reference string, which is commonly used in Operating Systems (OS) memory management to simulate how processes access memory pages.
The reference string is a sequence of page numbers requested during execution, and it is especially useful for testing and analyzing page replacement algorithms (like FIFO, LRU, Optimal, etc.).


Features

Randomized Page Access: Simulates realistic memory access patterns.

Locality of Reference: Supports sequential access, nearby page access, and random jumps.

Phased Working Sets: Simulates changes in process working sets over time.

Hot Pages: Allows certain pages to be favored and accessed more often.

Stride Access: Supports periodic sequential jumps in memory (stride bursts).

Reproducibility: Option to fix a random seed for consistent results.

How It Works

The function:

Initializes a working set of active pages.

Iterates through length page requests.

Decides the next page based on probabilities (page_sequence, page_local, page_jump).

Updates the working set at intervals (phase_size).

Optionally simulates hot pages or stride access patterns.

Returns the generated reference string as a list of integers.


Applications

Testing page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal).

Studying locality of reference in memory access patterns.

Teaching tool for Operating Systems courses.
